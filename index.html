                <h3>learning how to code to change life</h3>
                <p>In our Spring session, Le Wagon Montreal welcomed a 
                group of 26 students from eight different countries with 
                very diverse profiles: from international relations, to urban 
                planning and healthcare, to name a few. It was a real 
                pleasure to share these nine intensive weeks with them and 
                to witness their growth throughout the program.</p>
